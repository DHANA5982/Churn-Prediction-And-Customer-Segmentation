## Model Development Process

### 1. Baseline Model Performance

**Model**: Logistic Regression (Unchanged)

| Metric | Class 0 (Retained) | Class 1 (Churned) | Overall |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Precision** | 0.81 | 0.86 | 0.84 |
| **Recall** | 0.83 | 0.84 | 0.84 |
| **F1-Score** | 0.82 | 0.85 | 0.84 |

**Key Insights:**
- Baseline achieved solid 84% accuracy
- Slightly better performance on churn detection (Class 1)
- F1-score of 0.85 provided good starting point

### 2. Hyperparameter Optimization

**Optimization Strategy:**
- **Method**: Grid Search with 3-fold Cross-Validation
- **Search Space**: 1 hyperparameter combination
- **Total Fits**: 3 model trainings
- **Optimization Time**: 5.27 minutes

**Optimal Hyperparameters:**
```python
best_params = {
    'max_depth': 10,             # Limited depth to prevent overfitting
    'max_features': 'sqrt',      # âˆšn features per split (prevents overfitting)
    'min_samples_leaf': 1,       # Minimum samples per leaf node
    'min_samples_split': 5,      # Minimum samples to split node
    'n_estimators': 300          # 300 decision trees in ensemble
}
```

**Parameter Analysis:**
- **Limited max_depth (10)**: Prevents overfitting while capturing patterns
- **sqrt features**: Optimal balance between model diversity and performance
- **300 estimators**: Sufficient trees for stable predictions without diminishing returns
